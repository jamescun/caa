##Â Data Format

Authorities.json is an array of objects, where each object represents a legal entity which issues certificates. An authority may trade under a different name or issue certificates on behalf of another entity, these details are rolled into the same object as the primary authority.

Name         | Type          | Required | Description
-------------|---------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------
name         | string        | yes      | legal name of certificate authority
aliases      | array[string] | no       | array of alternative names for certificate authority
domains      | array[string] | yes      | array of domain names that are acceptable in a CAA record
certificates | object        | yes      | defines roots/intermediates an authority uses for issuance

### Fingerprint Format

Fingerprints are hexadecimal encoded certificate fingerprints, prefixed by the name of the cryptographic checksum used and a colon separator.

Currently `MD5`, `SHA1` and `SHA256` are expected to be accepted.
